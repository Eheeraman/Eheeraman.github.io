This is a basic discord bot that I made to help track your Valorant gaming session. 

Commands:
/start - begins a session and starts timing the session.
/current_stats - gives the user an update on their current session stats.
/game_stats - prompts the user to enter their game stats from their previous match.
/end - ends the session and provides the user of a stats summary from their gaming session.

NOTE: BOT_TOKEN and CHANNEL_ID are not provided for security.
